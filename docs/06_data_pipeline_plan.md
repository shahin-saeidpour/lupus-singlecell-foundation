# Phase 2 Data Pipeline Plan

## Phase 2 Goal

Phase 2 creates a reproducible scaffold for future single-cell data handling. It defines the structure for AnnData/Scanpy processing, metadata harmonization, QC planning, and patient-level split validation.

This phase does not download datasets, preprocess data, train models, or approve any dataset for modeling.

## Approved-With-Restrictions Dataset Context

Human Gate 1 is `approved_with_restrictions`.

- `GSE137029` is approved only as the primary candidate for Phase 2 pipeline development, not for modeling.
- `CELLxGENE/HCA 436154da-bcf1-4130-9c8b-120ff9a888f2 / 218acb0f-9f2f-4f76-b90b-15a4b7c7f629` is approved only for metadata harmonization design, not for modeling.
- `GSE174188` remains `needs_manual_verification` and is not part of Phase 2 processing.
- `GSE162577` remains `limited_candidate` and is not the primary Phase 2 candidate.
- `selected_datasets` remains empty until a later explicit human gate approves dataset selection.

## Data Lifecycle

Future data handling must separate lifecycle stages:

- Raw: immutable source files or approved source exports.
- Interim: validated local staging outputs created after an explicit acquisition feature.
- Processed: reproducible outputs created by documented QC and harmonization steps.

This scaffold does not create any raw, interim, or processed data files.

## Raw, Interim, and Processed Boundaries

Raw data must never be overwritten. Interim outputs must record provenance, checksums, source accession, and generation command. Processed objects must be reproducible from raw or approved interim inputs.

No data boundary is activated in P2-F001 because downloads and preprocessing are forbidden.

## AnnData Expectations

Future AnnData objects must define:

- `obs` fields for patient, donor, sample, cohort, batch, tissue, assay, and disease labels.
- `var` fields for gene identifier, gene symbol, feature type, and genome/reference if source-provided.
- `layers` policy for raw counts, normalized counts, and transformed matrices.
- `uns` provenance metadata for source, accession, pipeline version, and QC decisions.

P2-F001 does not create AnnData objects.

## AnnData Schema and Integrity Contract

The AnnData schema contract defines what future single-cell objects must contain before any downstream QC, harmonization, or patient-level split validation. P2-F002 defines the contract only; it does not create AnnData files or load real datasets.

### Expected AnnData Structure

Future AnnData-like objects must expose:

- `obs`: cell-level metadata table with one row per cell.
- `var`: feature-level metadata table with one row per gene or feature.
- `X`: primary cells-by-genes matrix.
- `layers`: named matrices for raw and transformed data states.
- `uns`: unstructured provenance and pipeline metadata.

### obs Requirements

Required future `obs` fields:

- `cell_id`
- `patient_id`
- `donor_id`
- `sample_id`
- `cohort_id`
- `batch_id`
- `tissue`
- `assay_type`
- `disease_label`
- `cell_type`
- `source_dataset`
- `split_group`

Patient, donor, sample, cohort, and batch fields must come from source metadata or approved harmonization rules. Missing values must remain `TODO` or `unclear` until verified.

### var Requirements

Required future `var` fields:

- `gene_id`
- `gene_symbol`
- `feature_type`
- `genome`

Gene identifiers must not be inferred from organism, assay, file name, or platform. They require source-supported feature metadata.

### X Matrix Expectations

`X` must be a cells-by-genes matrix. Its first dimension must match the number of `obs` rows, and its second dimension must match the number of `var` rows.

The matrix contents must not be assumed to be raw counts unless source documentation or approved inspection verifies that status.

### Layers Policy

Required future layers:

- `counts`
- `normalized`
- `log_normalized`

The `counts` layer is the protected raw-count layer and must not be overwritten. Normalized and log-normalized layers must be generated reproducibly by documented future pipeline steps.

### uns Metadata Policy

Required future `uns` fields:

- `dataset_id`
- `source`
- `preprocessing_version`
- `schema_version`
- `audit_status`
- `patient_level_split_policy`

`patient_level_split_policy` must indicate patient-level or cohort-level splitting only.

### Raw Count Policy

Raw counts must be preserved in `layers["counts"]` or another explicitly documented raw-count location. They must not be overwritten by normalized data.

### Normalized Data Policy

Normalized and log-normalized matrices must be derived from source-supported counts using a documented pipeline version. P2-F002 defines names and integrity rules only.

### Cell-Level Metadata Rules

Cell-level metadata may describe cell identity, source dataset, assay, tissue, and annotation. It must not be used to create random cell-level train/test splits.

### Patient-Level Metadata Rules

Patient-level or donor-level identifiers are required for modeling-ready data. Missing `patient_id` is a failure for modeling-ready data. If the source provides only `donor_id`, a future harmonization feature must explicitly document whether `donor_id` can serve as the split unit.

### Forbidden Assumptions

- Do not assume patient IDs from cell barcodes.
- Do not assume labels from accession names.
- Do not assume raw counts from assay type.
- Do not assume cell-type labels from publication title.
- Do not assume gene identifiers from human organism metadata.
- Do not assign cell-level split groups.
- Do not mark a dataset modeling-ready from schema compliance alone.

### Integrity Checks

Future validators must check:

- `obs` index uniqueness.
- `var` index uniqueness.
- `X` shape equals cells by genes.
- required `obs`, `var`, `layers`, and `uns` fields are present.
- no missing `patient_id` in modeling-ready data.
- no cell-level split assignment.
- `split_group` is patient-level or cohort-level only.
- unknown values are `TODO` or `unclear`, not guessed.

### Failure Modes

Validation must fail when:

- required `obs`, `var`, `layers`, or `uns` fields are missing.
- `patient_id` is missing in modeling-ready data.
- `disease_label` is missing.
- `split_group` or `patient_level_split_policy` indicates cell-level splitting.
- `obs` or `var` indexes are not unique.
- `X` shape does not match `obs` and `var`.

## Metadata Harmonization Strategy

Metadata harmonization maps source-specific fields from GEO, CELLxGENE, and HCA into a canonical metadata contract without guessing. P2-F003 defines the schema and mapping rules only; it does not download data, inspect full datasets, preprocess matrices, or create AnnData objects.

### Source Datasets

The current restricted Phase 2 design context includes:

- GEO candidate `GSE137029` for pipeline-development planning only.
- CELLxGENE/HCA lupus-linked metadata context for harmonization design only.
- Restricted or non-primary candidates remain out of processing until later explicit approval.

No source is selected for modeling by this harmonization schema.

### GEO Metadata Challenges

GEO records may distribute patient, sample, platform, and disease information across series-level records, sample-level records, supplementary file descriptions, and publication text. Sample titles may contain hints, but hints are not evidence for patient IDs, disease activity, treatment status, or batch labels. GEO metadata must therefore be mapped only after explicit field-level verification.

### CELLxGENE Metadata Challenges

CELLxGENE collections may expose standardized fields, ontology labels, donor metadata, cell-type annotations, and dataset-level provenance, but availability varies by collection and dataset. Donor/sample identifiers, raw count status, and disease activity labels must be treated as `TODO` or `unclear` unless visible in public metadata or later approved inspection.

### HCA Metadata Challenges

HCA metadata may use project, specimen, donor, library, and file-level entities. The harmonization step must preserve provenance from the specific HCA entity that supports each canonical field. HCA project context alone is not sufficient evidence for patient-level labels or split eligibility.

### Canonical Metadata Schema

The canonical schema is defined in `metadata/metadata_harmonization_schema.yaml`. It includes:

- `patient_id`
- `donor_id`
- `sample_id`
- `cell_id`
- `cohort_id`
- `batch_id`
- `dataset_id`
- `source_dataset`
- `source_database`
- `organism`
- `tissue`
- `assay_type`
- `disease_label`
- `disease_activity`
- `cell_type`
- `treatment_status`
- `sex`
- `age`
- `timepoint`
- `split_group`

### Harmonization Principles

- Preserve source values before applying any transformation.
- Record the source database and source dataset for every harmonized record.
- Prefer explicit patient or donor identifiers over derived sample labels.
- Keep source-specific terminology when no approved mapping exists.
- Avoid collapsing disease labels, activity labels, or treatment labels without a documented rule.
- Keep harmonization deterministic and auditable.

### Missing-Value Policy

Unknown values must remain `TODO` or `unclear`. Empty strings, inferred labels, and placeholder guesses are not acceptable for required future metadata. If a source field cannot be verified, the mapping file must retain `TODO` for the original field and transformation.

### Provenance Tracking

Every canonical field must be traceable to a source database, source dataset, and original source field once data acquisition is approved. Provenance must distinguish manually audited metadata from future machine-parsed metadata.

### Batch Awareness

Batch identifiers must come from explicit batch, library, processing, site, platform, lane, or cohort metadata. Batch labels must not be invented from file order, sample order, or accession suffixes.

### Patient-Level Requirements

Patient-level prediction requires patient or donor identifiers that support leakage-free splitting. Cell barcodes, sample titles, and inferred sample groupings are not valid patient identifiers unless a later manually approved evidence trail establishes the relationship.

### Forbidden Assumptions

- Do not infer disease labels from titles or accession names.
- Do not infer disease activity from diagnosis labels.
- Do not infer lupus nephritis status from kidney tissue alone.
- Do not infer treatment status from study design summaries.
- Do not infer patient IDs from sample IDs or cell barcodes.
- Do not infer batch labels from file names without source documentation.
- Do not assume CELLxGENE or HCA ontology fields are present before verification.

### Future Failure Modes

Harmonization must fail or remain blocked when:

- required canonical fields such as `dataset_id` or `disease_label` are missing.
- source mapping is still `TODO` for a field needed by a downstream task.
- patient, donor, sample, cohort, or batch relationships are ambiguous.
- values are inferred rather than source-supported.
- split metadata implies cell-level rather than patient-level or cohort-level partitioning.

Unknown fields must remain `TODO` or `unclear` until source evidence is available.

## Gene Identifier Policy

Gene identifier harmonization matters because downstream single-cell analysis, cross-cohort comparison, pathway enrichment, and foundation model compatibility all depend on consistent feature identities. P2-F004 defines policy only; it does not inspect real gene tables, download references, preprocess datasets, or convert identifiers.

### Gene Symbols vs Ensembl IDs

Future pipelines must preserve both original gene symbols and stable gene identifiers when source metadata provides them. Gene symbols are useful for interpretation and pathway tools, but they can be ambiguous, duplicated, or changed across releases. Ensembl IDs are more stable but may include version suffixes and require genome-build context. Neither identifier type may be inferred from organism, assay type, file name, or publication title.

### Human Genome Build Considerations

The `genome` field must preserve source-supported genome or reference-build metadata when available. If build metadata is not explicit, the value must remain `TODO` or `unclear`. Cross-cohort comparisons and pathway claims require a later reviewed policy for build compatibility and identifier version handling.

### Duplicate Gene Handling

Duplicate gene symbols or identifiers must be reported before any aggregation. Silent duplicate collapse is forbidden. A future approved preprocessing feature must document the duplicate set, source rows affected, chosen resolution rule, and scientific risk before any matrix transformation occurs.

### Missing Gene Handling

Missing, unmapped, or unsupported gene identifiers must be reported in `reports/tables/gene_mapping_report.csv` or a future derived report. Silent gene dropping is forbidden. Missing identifiers may block cross-cohort integration, pathway analysis, or foundation model vocabulary alignment.

### Mitochondrial/Ribosomal Gene Handling

Mitochondrial and ribosomal gene flags may be needed for QC, but they must be derived from source-supported or approved reference mappings. These genes must not be dropped by default. Any future QC filtering rule must preserve an audit trail and report affected genes.

### Pathway Analysis Requirements

Pathway analysis requires valid, documented gene symbols or stable identifiers compatible with the selected pathway database. Multiple-testing correction is required later before making pathway claims. Pathway claims without verified identifier mapping are forbidden.

### Foundation Model Vocabulary Requirements

Foundation model compatibility requires tracking the model vocabulary version, overlap between dataset genes and model vocabulary, and unmatched vocabulary entries. Vocabulary overlap must be reported before any model-facing data preparation. This policy does not select, load, or train a model.

### Cross-Cohort Gene Intersection Strategy

Future cross-cohort harmonization must compute gene intersections only after source gene identifiers are validated. Intersection decisions must report retained genes, dropped genes, duplicates, unmapped genes, and cohort-specific losses. No feature may silently drop genes to force an intersection.

### Forbidden Assumptions

- Do not infer Ensembl IDs from gene symbols without an approved mapping source.
- Do not infer gene symbols from Ensembl IDs without an approved mapping source.
- Do not infer genome build from organism or assay type.
- Do not assume duplicate symbols can be summed, averaged, or first-selected.
- Do not assume missing genes can be silently dropped.
- Do not assume foundation model compatibility from human organism alone.
- Do not make pathway claims from unmapped or ambiguously mapped genes.

### Failure Modes

Gene identifier validation must fail or remain blocked when:

- required gene fields are missing.
- the feature index is not unique.
- duplicate symbols or IDs exist without a duplicate report.
- unmapped genes exist without an unmapped-gene report.
- requested pathway analysis lacks valid mapped identifiers.
- requested foundation model preparation lacks vocabulary version and overlap reports.

### Audit Trail Requirements

Every future identifier transformation must record the source dataset, original gene ID, original gene symbol, target ID, mapping method, mapping source/version, duplicate status, unmapped status, foundation vocabulary match status, pathway eligibility, and audit status. P2-F004 creates the report header only.

## Patient-level and Cohort-level Split Protocol

All future split logic must be patient-level, donor-level, or cohort-level only. Cell-level splits are forbidden because cells from the same patient or donor share biological state, clinical labels, processing history, and batch context. Randomly splitting cells can produce optimistic performance by allowing the model to see patient-specific or batch-specific signal in both training and test partitions.

### Why Cell-Level Split Is Forbidden

Single-cell datasets contain many cells per patient. Treating cells as independent training examples while splitting randomly by cell leaks patient, donor, sample, and batch information across partitions. This leakage can make a model appear accurate even when it has not learned generalizable disease biology.

### Leakage Risks in Single-Cell Datasets

Leakage can occur through shared patient identity, donor identity, sample preparation, library batch, tissue compartment, cell barcodes, repeated visits, or cohort-specific processing. Label leakage can also occur when disease labels, activity labels, treatment labels, or sample names are encoded in metadata fields used during splitting or feature construction.

### Patient-Level Split Definition

A patient-level split assigns each `patient_id` to exactly one split partition. All cells and samples from the same patient must remain in the same partition. Patient-level splitting requires source-supported patient IDs or an explicitly approved equivalent split unit.

### Donor-Level Split Definition

A donor-level split assigns each `donor_id` to exactly one split partition. Donor-level splitting can be used only when donor IDs are explicit and a future audit confirms that donor ID is the correct leakage-prevention unit for the dataset.

### Sample-Level Caveats

Sample-level splitting is not sufficient when multiple samples come from the same patient or donor. If patient IDs are unavailable, sample-level splits must be treated as provisional and cannot support patient-level prediction unless a later audit proves no patient or donor overlap is possible.

### Cohort-Level Split Definition

A cohort-level split assigns whole cohorts, studies, sites, or collections to partitions. Leave-cohort-out validation and external validation require that held-out cohorts remain independent from training data at patient, donor, sample, cell, and processing levels.

### Repeated Samples / Longitudinal Handling

Repeated or longitudinal samples from the same patient must stay together unless the prediction task explicitly concerns time and a later protocol defines leakage-safe temporal validation. Visit labels and timepoints must not be used to split cells from the same patient into different partitions.

### Batch-Aware Split Considerations

Split plans must inspect batch distribution across patient, donor, sample, and cohort. Batch-aware review is required because technical batch can be confounded with disease, treatment, tissue, or cohort labels. Batch balancing must not override patient-level or cohort-level leakage prevention.

### External Validation Split Requirements

External validation must use an independent cohort or source-supported holdout design. The external validation cohort must not share patients, donors, samples, cells, or unreviewed processing dependencies with training data. `external_validation_cohort` remains `TODO` until a later explicit human gate.

### Disease-Label Stratification Considerations

Disease-label distribution should be reviewed at patient or donor level, not cell level. Stratification may be desirable for diagnosis or activity tasks, but it cannot create patient/donor overlap. Rare disease labels may require a scientific decision to defer modeling or use a limited validation design.

### Forbidden Split Patterns

- Cell-level random train/test splits.
- Barcode-level splits.
- Splitting cells from one patient across partitions.
- Splitting donors across partitions.
- Treating samples as independent when patient or donor overlap is unresolved.
- Assigning an external validation cohort without audit approval.
- Using disease labels, treatment labels, or activity labels to infer patient IDs.

### Required Leakage Checks

Future split manifests must check:

- no `patient_id` overlap between train and test.
- no `donor_id` overlap between train and test.
- no sample overlap when patient identity is unknown.
- no held-out cohort overlap in external validation.
- no cell or barcode entity types in split manifests.
- all split rows have an `audit_status`.

### Failure Modes

Split validation must fail or remain blocked when:

- `entity_type` is `cell_id` or `barcode`.
- the same entity appears in incompatible train/test partitions.
- `audit_status` is missing.
- split values are outside the approved manifest vocabulary.
- patient/donor/sample relationships are unresolved.
- an external validation cohort is assigned without a later gate.

## Single-cell QC Protocol

Single-cell QC must protect biological interpretation, patient-level validity, and cross-cohort comparability before any downstream analysis. P2-F005 defines policy and report scaffolds only; it does not download data, preprocess real datasets, create AnnData outputs, remove cells, infer thresholds, or run modeling.

### Cell-Level QC Goals

Future cell-level QC must evaluate per-cell detected genes, total counts, mitochondrial percentage, ribosomal percentage, doublet risk, cell type if available, batch, sample, and patient membership. These metrics must be summarized before any filtering decision.

### Sample-Level QC Goals

Future sample-level QC must report cell counts, median genes per cell, median counts per cell, median mitochondrial percentage, doublet rate, disease-label distribution, and batch representation. Samples with unusually low cell counts or extreme metrics require audit notes before any action.

### Patient-Level QC Goals

Future patient-level QC must summarize the number of samples, total cells, disease labels, treatment status when source-supported, and batch distribution. Patient-level summaries are required because prediction and split policies are patient-level or cohort-level, not cell-level.

### Batch-Aware QC

QC decisions must be inspected by batch, cohort, sample, and patient. A threshold that disproportionately removes cells from a disease group, patient subset, tissue, or batch is a scientific risk and must be documented before use.

### Mitochondrial Percentage Handling

Mitochondrial percentage can indicate poor-quality cells, stress, or tissue-specific biology. It must not be thresholded automatically. Source assay, tissue, disease context, and batch distribution must be reviewed before selecting any cutoff.

### Detected Gene Count Handling

Detected gene count thresholds must not be guessed. Future thresholds require pre/post summaries, rationale, approval, and documentation of how many cells, samples, and patients would be affected.

### UMI/Count Depth Handling

Total UMI or count depth must be summarized at cell, sample, patient, and batch levels. Low-depth and high-depth outliers may indicate technical artifacts, but filtering requires an explicit audit decision.

### Doublet Risk Handling

Doublet scores or doublet annotations must be treated as risk indicators until the scoring method, source, and tissue-specific assumptions are documented. Doublet removal cannot occur without a logged threshold decision.

### Ambient RNA Risk Handling

Ambient RNA can distort cell-type and disease signatures. Future ambient RNA checks must record method, assumptions, tissue context, and affected genes or cell types before any correction is applied.

### Tissue-Specific QC Considerations

PBMC and kidney/lupus nephritis samples may need different QC expectations. Tissue context must be explicit before comparing QC metrics across cohorts. A single global threshold across tissues is not allowed without documented justification.

### PBMC-Specific QC Considerations

PBMC datasets may vary in immune activation state, sample handling, cryopreservation, granulocyte contamination, platelet contamination, and mitochondrial percentages. Lupus PBMCs may show biology that resembles stress or activation, so automatic filtering can erase disease-relevant signal.

### Lupus-Specific Caveats

SLE and lupus nephritis cohorts may differ by treatment, disease activity, tissue source, batch, flare status, and clinical severity. QC must avoid removing cells or patients in ways that confound disease labels, treatment labels, activity labels, or external validation suitability.

### No Automatic Thresholding Without Audit

No QC threshold may be applied without an explicit threshold source, rationale, approval, before/after counts, and audit status. `threshold_source: guessed` is forbidden. Real filtering remains disabled until a later approved feature.

### QC Report Requirements

Required future QC outputs are:

- `reports/tables/qc_summary.csv`
- `reports/tables/qc_threshold_decisions.csv`

QC reports must preserve dataset, sample, patient, batch, disease label, metric, threshold, rationale, approval, notes, and audit status.

### Failure Modes

QC validation must fail or remain blocked when:

- real filtering is enabled before approval.
- thresholds are guessed.
- thresholds are marked applied without approval.
- cell removal is unlogged.
- sample-level or patient-level summaries are missing.
- batch, disease, tissue, or patient effects are not documented.
- QC decisions would create leakage or label imbalance risks.

## Leakage Prevention Protocol

Leakage is dangerous in single-cell patient-level prediction because a model can learn patient identity, donor identity, sample preparation, batch effects, barcode artifacts, or label-encoded metadata instead of disease biology. P2-F007 creates mock-data validation utilities and tests only; it does not download data, preprocess real datasets, create real splits, create AnnData outputs, or run modeling.

### Cell-Level Leakage Definition

Cell-level leakage occurs when cells from the same patient, donor, sample, or cohort appear in incompatible split partitions. Random cell-level train/test splits are forbidden because cells from one biological entity are not independent observations for patient-level prediction.

### Patient Overlap Leakage

Patient overlap leakage occurs when the same `patient_id` appears in more than one split. All cells and samples from one patient must remain in a single partition unless a future approved temporal-validation protocol explicitly defines a different leakage-safe design.

### Donor Overlap Leakage

Donor overlap leakage occurs when the same `donor_id` appears in more than one split. Donor-level overlap is unsafe even when patient IDs are unavailable, because donor-specific expression and technical metadata can leak across partitions.

### Sample Overlap Leakage

Sample overlap leakage occurs when the same `sample_id` appears in more than one split. Sample overlap is especially risky when patient IDs are missing or unresolved.

### Cohort Contamination

Cohort contamination occurs when a cohort intended for holdout or external validation shares patients, donors, samples, cells, or unreviewed processing dependencies with training data. Leave-cohort-out and external-validation designs must keep held-out cohorts independent.

### Batch Leakage

Batch leakage occurs when split membership is confounded with technical batch, library, site, lane, or processing pipeline. A split containing only one batch, or a label perfectly tied to one batch, must be flagged before any modeling.

### Label Leakage

Label leakage occurs when disease labels, treatment labels, activity labels, sample names, cohort names, or other metadata encode the target label in a way that can be learned directly. Labels perfectly tied to split partitions are a failure until reviewed.

### Duplicated Barcode / Cell ID Leakage

Duplicated cell IDs or barcodes across split partitions suggest duplicated observations or non-independent records. Duplicated cell or barcode identifiers across splits must fail validation.

### Required Checks Before Modeling

Before any modeling-ready dataset can advance, future checks must verify:

- no cell-level or barcode-level split entities.
- no patient overlap across incompatible partitions.
- no donor overlap across incompatible partitions.
- no sample overlap across incompatible partitions.
- no duplicated cell IDs or barcodes across splits.
- no cohort contamination for holdout or external validation.
- no unresolved batch confounding.
- no label perfectly tied to split membership.
- every row has an `audit_status`.

### Failure Modes

Leakage validation must fail or remain blocked when:

- `entity_type` is `cell_id` or `barcode`.
- a patient, donor, or sample appears in more than one split.
- duplicated cell or barcode IDs appear across splits.
- a split contains only one batch without audit justification.
- disease labels are perfectly tied to split partitions.
- audit status is missing.
- external validation cohort independence is unresolved.

### Judge Rejection Rules

Scientific and bioinformatics judges must reject any future modeling-readiness claim when:

- cell-level splitting is used.
- patient, donor, or sample overlap is unresolved.
- cohort independence is not demonstrated.
- batch or label leakage is unreviewed.
- duplicated cells or barcodes are present across splits.
- leakage checks are missing, incomplete, or based on guessed metadata.

## Cohort Manifest Design

The cohort manifest is the central future tracking table for candidate datasets, cohorts, samples, batches, tissues, assay types, access restrictions, and intended roles. P2-F008 defines schema, an empty manifest table, and mock validation only; it does not download data, preprocess data, create AnnData outputs, approve cohorts, or assign official training or external validation cohorts.

### Purpose of Cohort Manifest

The manifest creates one auditable location for tracking candidate cohort metadata before any acquisition, QC, splitting, or modeling work. It separates candidate planning from approved use so that no dataset becomes training or external validation input without explicit review.

### Dataset vs Cohort vs Sample Distinction

A dataset is a public source object such as a GEO series, CELLxGENE dataset, HCA project, or published object. A cohort is a biologically or procedurally meaningful group within or across datasets, such as a study arm, site, tissue, or collection. A sample is a source-supported biological specimen linked to a patient or donor when available. These levels must not be collapsed without documented evidence.

### Source Dataset Tracking

Every manifest row must preserve source, accession or collection ID, dataset ID, candidate ID, and provenance URL. Source identifiers must be verified from public metadata or later approved access; they must not be inferred from file names or notes.

### Access Restriction Tracking

The manifest must track whether raw data, processed objects, and relevant metadata are open, controlled, unclear, or TODO. Controlled-access risks must remain explicit and cannot be treated as available data.

### Tissue and Assay Tracking

Tissue and assay fields are required for compatibility checks across PBMC, kidney, lupus nephritis, and other tissue contexts. Assay type must support future single-cell validity checks and cannot be inferred from study title alone.

### Batch and Site Metadata

Batch, site, cohort, and processing metadata are required for leakage prevention and cross-cohort evaluation. Missing or unclear batch metadata must remain a risk field, not a reason to invent a batch label.

### Intended Role vs Approved Role

`intended_role` records planning intent only, such as `candidate_training`, `candidate_external_validation`, or `candidate_reference`. `approved_role` must remain `TODO` or `none` until an explicit human gate approves a role. Intended roles are not approvals.

### Candidate Status Policy

Rows in the manifest represent candidate or planning records unless later human gates explicitly change their status. Candidate status must preserve risk level, notes, provenance, and audit status.

### External Validation Caution

External validation candidates require independent cohort evidence, compatible labels, compatible tissue and assay, and no overlap with training data. The manifest must not assign `external_validation_cohort`; that project-state field remains `TODO`.

### Provenance Requirements

Any manifest row must include a provenance URL and audit status. Rows without provenance cannot support training, validation, external validation, or reference roles.

### Failure Modes

Manifest validation must fail or remain blocked when:

- required fields are missing.
- provenance URL is missing.
- audit status is missing.
- intended role is outside the candidate-role vocabulary.
- approved role is `training` or `external_validation` without explicit human-gate approval.
- a row attempts to imply selected dataset assignment.
- access, tissue, assay, label, batch, or processed-object status is unclear for a proposed role.

## Candidate Dataset Access Plan

The candidate dataset access plan documents future acquisition requirements for Phase 2 planning candidates without acquiring any files. P2-F009 covers access metadata, permission gates, storage concerns, provenance requirements, and validation checks only. It does not fetch datasets, create AnnData objects, preprocess data, approve datasets for modeling, or assign selected cohorts.

### Candidate Dataset Access Goals

The plan records what must be verified before any future data acquisition feature can run. It keeps access planning separate from approval and ensures that metadata, file inventory, storage, checksum, and human-gate requirements are visible before any file movement.

### GSE137029 Expected Access Route

`GSE137029` is a restricted Phase 2 primary pipeline candidate for planning only. Future access planning may inspect the GEO metadata page, SRA links if explicitly needed later, and supplementary processed files only if manually verified and explicitly approved in a later feature. It is not approved for download or modeling.

### CELLxGENE/HCA Expected Access Route

The CELLxGENE/HCA candidate is limited to metadata harmonization planning. Future access planning may use the CELLxGENE collection page, HCA project page, and H5AD asset metadata only after explicit approval. It is not assigned as an external validation cohort and is not approved for download or modeling.

### Raw vs Processed Object Distinction

Raw files, raw count matrices, processed matrices, and analysis-ready objects have different scientific and reproducibility implications. Future acquisition must verify which object type is available, whether raw counts are preserved, and whether processed objects include enough metadata for patient-level validation.

### Controlled-Access Caution

Controlled-access, restricted, or unclear assets must remain unavailable until access conditions, permissions, and data-use restrictions are documented. Controlled access cannot be treated as open availability.

### Download Approval Gate

All candidates require a later explicit human download gate before any file acquisition. `allow_downloads` remains false in project state, and candidate rows must keep `approved_for_download=false`.

### Checksum / Provenance Requirements

Before future acquisition, the project must define file inventory, source URLs, checksums, manifest paths, access timestamp, command provenance, and validation rules. No untracked source file should enter the workflow.

### Local Storage Policy

Future data files must be placed only under approved raw/interim/processed boundaries after an explicit feature enables acquisition. P2-F009 does not create data files or storage directories.

### File-Size Risk

Single-cell objects can be large. Future access approval must estimate storage size before acquisition and verify that local storage, backup policy, and reproducibility logs are adequate.

### Reproducibility Requirements

Future acquisition must record source identifier, source route, file list, checksums, software versions, environment, and human approval. Reproducibility records must distinguish metadata planning from acquired data.

### Forbidden Actions

- Do not acquire real files.
- Do not run network fetch commands.
- Do not call CELLxGENE, Scanpy, or other data-access clients.
- Do not create AnnData objects.
- Do not preprocess matrices.
- Do not approve datasets for modeling.
- Do not assign selected datasets or external validation cohorts.

### Failure Modes

Access validation must fail or remain blocked when:

- `approved_for_download` is true.
- `approved_for_modeling` is true.
- required pre-acquisition checks are empty.
- audit status is not `pending_human_download_gate`.
- selected datasets or external validation cohort are assigned.
- storage size, provenance, checksum, or access restrictions are unresolved.

## Reproducibility Policy

Every future pipeline step must record:

- source accession or collection ID
- input path or manifest
- output path
- command or script
- software version
- random seed where relevant
- checksums for downloaded or generated files after explicit acquisition approval

## Forbidden Actions

- Downloading full datasets.
- Creating AnnData objects in this feature.
- Running Scanpy preprocessing in this feature.
- Training or implementing models.
- Creating model files.
- Approving datasets for modeling.
- Creating `selected_datasets`.
- Assigning `external_validation_cohort`.
- Splitting cells.
- Inferring patient IDs, labels, activity scores, treatment metadata, batch metadata, cell-type labels, or gene identifiers.

## Phase 2 Exit Criteria

Phase 2 scaffold is complete when:

- data-pipeline config exists and blocks downloads/modeling
- source package directories exist
- scaffold validation script confirms Phase 2 restrictions
- tests verify no downloads, no modeling, no cell-level splits, and no selected datasets

Later Phase 2 features must still pass explicit human and judge gates before acquisition, QC, labels, or prediction tasks are advanced.
