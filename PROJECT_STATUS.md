# Project Status — Lupus Single-Cell Foundation Model

## Current scientific objective

The project investigates whether frozen single-cell foundation-model representations can support patient-level discrimination of active SLE flare from managed SLE using peripheral blood single-cell RNA-seq data.

The current working framing is:

> Frozen Geneformer embeddings encode patient-level transcriptional structure sufficient to discriminate active SLE flare from managed SLE in a large PBMC single-cell cohort.

This project must not be framed as future flare prediction unless longitudinal pre-flare samples are added. The current task is active flare discrimination.

## Primary dataset

Primary cohort:

- Dataset: GSE174188 / Perez et al. lupus PBMC single-cell RNA-seq cohort
- Source used in exploratory work: CELLxGENE Census
- CELLxGENE dataset_id: `218acb0f-9f2f-4f76-b90b-15a4b7c7f629`
- Census version used in exploratory notebooks: `2025-11-08`
- Approximate exploratory cohort size:
  - 1,263,438 cells after initial loading/QC record
  - 261 donors/patients
  - 14 Flare
  - 149 Managed SLE
  - 98 Healthy

Working label rule from `donor_id`:

- `FLARE*` -> Flare
- `HC-*` or `IGTB*` -> Healthy
- numeric donor IDs -> Managed SLE

This label rule is currently exploratory and must be formalized, tested, and documented before publication claims.

## Current repository mismatch

The repository currently contains historical scaffold and synthetic Phase 1 validation artifacts.

Important mismatch:

- The checked-in Phase 1 report currently represents a synthetic validation fixture.
- The real GSE174188/CELLxGENE exploratory analysis was performed in Kaggle notebooks.
- The repository state files still contain old gate/blocker language that does not yet reflect the real exploratory Kaggle results.

Therefore, the immediate priority is repository reconciliation before additional modeling.

## Completed exploratory work outside the clean pipeline

### Phase 1 — exploratory dataset loading and QC

Exploratory Kaggle notebook:

- `notebooks/phase1_kaggle.ipynb`

Known outputs from exploratory run:

- `patient_summary.csv`
- `lupus_phase1_processed.h5ad` outside repo/Kaggle environment

Known issue to fix in production pipeline:

- mitochondrial QC must use validated gene symbols or correct feature metadata
- Census `var_names` / `feature_id` handling must be tested

---

### Phase 2 — exploratory Geneformer embedding extraction

Exploratory output:

- 261 per-patient `.npy` embedding files
- expected shape per patient: `(300, 1152)`
- dtype: `float32`

Geneformer details from exploratory run:

- Model: `ctheodoris/Geneformer`
- Architecture: BERT-style model
- Hidden size: 1152
- Vocab size must come from `model.config.vocab_size`
- Observed config vocab size: 20275
- Max sequence length used: 1024
- Cells per patient: 300
- Batch size: 16

Critical production requirements:

- create an embedding manifest
- record sampled cell IDs
- record random seed
- record model/config/vocabulary hashes
- test that token IDs are below model vocab size
- test that all embeddings are finite and match patient metadata

---

### Phase 3 — exploratory classification and validation

Exploratory task:

- Patient-level binary classification
- Mean pooling over per-cell Geneformer embeddings
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Leave-one-out cross-validation

Exploratory results:

| Task | AUROC | Sensitivity |
|---|---:|---:|
| Flare vs Healthy | ~0.993 | 12/14 |
| Flare vs Managed | ~0.996 | 14/14 |

Exploratory controls:

- permutation testing
- female-only control
- ancestry-stratified checks
- raw/pseudobulk baseline comparison

Known production fixes required:

- StandardScaler must be inside each cross-validation fold
- p-values must use a finite permutation correction, not be reported as 0.0000
- raw/pseudobulk baseline must be reproducible from script
- predictions and metrics must be saved as versioned artifacts
- confidence intervals must be added
- confounder controls must be formalized

---

## Main scientific risk

The main risk is not lack of signal. The main risk is overclaiming.

Geneformer appears to perform strongly, but the raw/pseudobulk baseline is also very strong. Therefore, the paper cannot rely only on a small AUROC improvement.

The final paper must answer:

1. Does frozen Geneformer provide incremental value beyond raw/pseudobulk expression?
2. Is the signal driven by within-cell-type transcriptional state, cell-type composition, or both?
3. Is performance robust to sex, ancestry, cell-count, and composition confounding?
4. Can the signal generalize under external or dataset-shift validation?

## Current target paper framing

Preferred framing:

> A reproducible benchmark of frozen single-cell foundation-model embeddings for patient-level SLE activity discrimination.

Avoid framing:

> A clinical future flare prediction model.

Avoid claiming:

> Fully zero-shot flare prediction.

Correct wording:

> Zero-shot Geneformer feature extraction with supervised patient-level linear evaluation.

## Immediate engineering plan

Stage 0: COMPLETE

- Repository state was reconciled with the real exploratory Kaggle work.
- Historical synthetic/scaffold artifacts are retained only as provenance.

Stage 1: COMPLETE

- Tested package utilities define donor labels, metadata extraction,
  mitochondrial annotation, cohort summaries, AnnData schema validation,
  ingestion readiness, and the ingestion manifest contract.
- Stage 1 completed with the closeout gate merged on `main`.

Stage 2: COMPLETE — package-side embedding extraction infrastructure

Completed:

- `STAGE2-F001 - Reproducible Geneformer embedding extraction plan`
- `STAGE2-F002 - Embedding config contract`
- `STAGE2-F003 - Embedding provenance manifest`
- `STAGE2-F004 - Dry-run extraction readiness`
- `STAGE2-F005 - Actual Geneformer extraction runner`

Current closeout branch:

- `STAGE2-CLOSEOUT - Stage 2 closeout gate`
- Branch: `chore/stage2-closeout`

Stage 2 completed package-side infrastructure for future Geneformer embedding
extraction. The package now has config, provenance, dry-run readiness, and a
permission-gated dependency-injected runner interface.

Stage 2 did not download data, load real AnnData files, execute real
Geneformer/tokenizer logic, commit embedding artifacts, train models, perform
external validation, or add performance claims.

## Current Stage 1 package foundation

Completed on `main`:

- `src/lupusfm/data/labels.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_labels.py`
- `src/lupusfm/data/metadata.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_metadata.py`
- `src/lupusfm/qc/mitochondrial.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_mitochondrial.py`
- `src/lupusfm/data/cohort.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_cohort.py`
- `src/lupusfm/data/anndata_schema.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_anndata_schema.py`
- `src/lupusfm/data/ingestion_readiness.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_ingestion_readiness.py`
- `src/lupusfm/data/manifest.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_manifest.py`

Completed Stage 2 package foundation:

- `src/lupusfm/embeddings/config.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_embedding_config.py`
- `src/lupusfm/embeddings/provenance.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_embedding_provenance.py`
- `src/lupusfm/embeddings/readiness.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_embedding_readiness.py`
- `src/lupusfm/embeddings/extraction.py`
- `tests/test_lupusfm_geneformer_extraction_runner.py`

Important safety decisions implemented:

- donor metadata must come from explicit `adata.obs` columns
- unknown donor-id patterns fail closed
- mitochondrial annotation requires an explicit gene-symbol column
- mitochondrial annotation refuses silent fallback to `adata.var_names`
- cohort summaries count donors and cells only; they do not filter, embed, or train
- AnnData schema validation rejects cell-level split assignments before modeling
- ingestion-readiness reports collect validation failures instead of starting downstream work
- manifest utilities keep downloads, embedding extraction, modeling, and training disabled
- embedding config utilities keep downloads, AnnData loading, Geneformer execution,
  tokenizer execution, embedding extraction, modeling, training, external
  validation, and performance claims disabled
- embedding provenance utilities keep extraction marked as not performed and
  require pending or valid recorded sha256 status for runtime provenance records
- embedding dry-run readiness collects failures across manifest, readiness,
  config, provenance, and output-path consistency before any runtime work starts
- the Geneformer extraction runner requires explicit permission and caller-
  provided callbacks before runtime actions can be invoked
- downloads, modeling, training, external validation, and performance claims
  remain prohibited even for the extraction runner

## Next stage recommendation

Next stage:

`STAGE3 - Patient-level embedding aggregation and leakage-safe evaluation design`

Stage 3 should first define patient-level aggregation, split policy, baseline
controls, and evaluation contracts. It should remain conservative: active SLE
flare discrimination only, no future flare prediction claim, no cell-level
splits, and no modeling until an explicit modeling gate is approved.
